<p class="subsection">             (4)  This section does not authorise a prescribed authority to dispense with the consent of a person to a marriage of a minor where any other person whose consent to the marriage is required by this Act has refused to give consent, unless a magistrate or a Judge has, in pursuance of this Part, given consent in place of the consent of that other person.

<p class="subsection">             (5)  For the purposes of this section, the fact that a person does not reside in, or is absent from, Australia shall not of itself be deemed to make it impracticable to ascertain the views of that person.

<p class="paragraph">                     (b)  an application by the minor under section 15 to dispense with the consent of a person to the marriage is refused;

<p class="subsection2">the minor may apply to a Judge or magistrate for the consent of a Judge or the magistrate to the marriage in place of the consent of that person.

<p class="subsection">             (2)  The Judge or magistrate shall, subject to subsections (2A) and (3), hold an inquiry into the relevant facts and circumstances and, if satisfied:

<p class="paragraph">                     (a)  in a case to which paragraph (1)(a) applies—that the person who has refused to consent to the marriage has refused consent unreasonably; or

<p class="paragraph">                     (b)  in a case to which paragraph (1)(b) applies—that, having proper regard for the welfare of the minor, it would be unreasonable for the Judge or magistrate to refuse consent to the proposed marriage;

<p class="subsection2">may give consent to the marriage in place of the consent of the person in relation to whose consent the application is made.

<p class="subsection">          (2A)  A Judge or magistrate shall not proceed with an inquiry in accordance with subsection (2) unless:

<p class="subsection">             (4)  Where a magistrate grants an application under subsection (1), the magistrate shall not issue consent in writing to the marriage before the expiration of the time prescribed for the purposes of section 17 and if, within that time, a request for a re‑hearing is made under that section, the magistrate shall not issue consent unless that request is withdrawn.

<p class="subsection">             (5)  Where a Judge or magistrate gives consent to the marriage of a minor in place of the consent of a person who has refused to consent to the marriage, the Judge or magistrate may also, upon application by the minor, give consent in place of the consent of any other person if the Judge or magistrate is satisfied that it is impracticable, or that it is impracticable without delay that would, in all the circumstances of the case, be unreasonable, to ascertain the views of that person with respect to the proposed marriage.

<p class="subsection">             (6)  For the purposes of subsection (5), the fact that a person does not reside in, or is absent from, Australia shall not of itself be deemed to make it impracticable to ascertain the views of that person.

<p class="subsection">             (3)  However, if the signature of a party to an intended marriage cannot conveniently be obtained at the time when it is desired to give notice under this section, a notice duly signed by the other party and otherwise complying with the provisions of this section shall, if it is signed by the first‑mentioned party in the presence of an authorised celebrant before the marriage is solemnised, be deemed to have been a sufficient notice.

<p class="subsection">             (4)  Where a party to an intended marriage is unable, after reasonable inquiry, to ascertain all of the particulars in relation to that party required to be contained in a notice under this section, the failure to include in the notice such of those particulars as the party is unable to ascertain does not make the notice ineffective for the purposes of this section if, at any time before the marriage is solemnised, that party furnishes to the authorised celebrant solemnising the marriage a statutory declaration as to that party’s inability to ascertain the particulars not included in the notice and the reason for that inability.

<p class="subsection">             (5)  Despite a notice required by subsection (1) having been received later than 1 month before the date of the marriage, a prescribed authority may authorise an authorised celebrant to solemnise a marriage if the authority is satisfied that one or more of the circumstances prescribed in the regulations have been met.

<p class="subsection">          (5A)  An authorised celebrant shall, as soon as practicable after receiving the notice referred to in subsection (1), give to the parties a document outlining the obligations and consequences of marriage and indicating the availability of marriage education and counselling.

<p class="subsection">             (6)  Where, by reason of the death, absence or illness of an authorised celebrant to whom a notice of intention to marry has been given, or for any other reason, it is impracticable for that person to solemnise the marriage, the marriage may be solemnised by any authorised celebrant who has possession of the notice.

<p class="subsection">             (7)  The declarations of the parties required by subsection (1) shall both be written on the one paper and on the same side of that paper.

<p class="subsection">             (8)  An authorised celebrant shall not solemnise a marriage:

<p class="paragraph">                     (a)  unless the authorised celebrant has satisfied himself or herself that the parties are the parties referred to in the notice given under this section in relation to the marriage; or

<p class="paragraph">                     (b)  if the authorised celebrant has reason to believe that:

<p class="paragraphsub">                              (i)  a notice given under this section; or

<p class="paragraphsub">                             (ii)  a declaration made and subscribed under this section, or a statutory declaration made for the purposes of this section;

<p class="subsection2">in relation to the marriage, contains a false statement or an error or is defective.

<p class="subsection">             (9)  An authorised celebrant may permit an error in a notice under this section to be corrected in his or her presence by either of the parties at any time before the marriage to which it relates has been solemnised and may treat the corrected notice as having been originally given in its corrected form.

<p class="subsection">           (10)  Where the declaration made by a party under subsection (1) states that that party is a divorced person or a widow or widower, an authorised celebrant shall not solemnise the marriage unless there is produced to him or her evidence of that party’s divorce, or of the death of that party’s spouse, as the case requires.

##### 42A  Commissioner of Australian Federal Police or approved authority may issue special notice

<p class="subsection">             (1)  If the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police or a person who is an approved authority for the purposes of the *Witness Protection Act 1994 *gives to a Registrar a certificate under section 14 of that Act stating that the person has received the evidence referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c) of that section and the statutory declaration referred to in paragraph (d) of that section, the Registrar:

<p class="paragraph">                     (a)  if he or she is to solemnise the marriage himself or herself—is to treat the certificate as satisfying the requirements of section 42; or

<p class="paragraph">                     (b)  in any other case—is to give to the celebrant a notice stating that the celebrant should treat the requirements of section 42 of this Act as having been met.

<p class="subsection">             (2)  The names specified in the certificate are to be used in the marriage certificate.

##### 43  Marriage may be solemnised on any day etc.

##### 45  Form of ceremony

<p class="subsection">             (1)  Where a marriage is solemnised by or in the presence of an authorised celebrant, being a minister of religion, it may be solemnised according to any form and ceremony recognised as sufficient for the purpose by the religious body or organisation of which he or she is a minister.

<p class="subsection">             (2)  Where a marriage is solemnised by or in the presence of an authorised celebrant, not being a minister of religion, it is sufficient if each of the parties says to the other, in the presence of the authorised celebrant and the witnesses, the words:

<p class="subsection2">“I call upon the persons here present to witness that I, A.B. (*or* C.D.), take thee, C.D. (*or* A.B.), to be my lawful wedded wife (*or* husband)”;

<p class="subsection2">or words to that effect.

<p class="subsection">             (3)  Where a marriage has been solemnised by or in the presence of an authorised celebrant, a certificate of the marriage prepared and signed in accordance with section 50 is conclusive evidence that the marriage was solemnised in accordance with this section.

<p class="subsection">             (4)  Nothing in subsection (3) makes a certificate conclusive:

<p class="paragraph">                     (a)  where the fact that the marriage ceremony took place is in issue—as to that fact; or

<p class="paragraph">                     (b)  where the identity of a party to the marriage is in issue—as to the identity of that party.

##### 46  Certain authorised celebrants to explain nature of marriage relationship

<p class="subsection">             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), before a marriage is solemnised by or in the presence of an authorised celebrant, not being a minister of religion of a recognised denomination, the authorised celebrant shall say to the parties, in the presence of the witnesses, the words:

<p class="subsection2">“I am duly authorised by law to solemnise marriages according to law. 

<p class="subsection2">“Before you are joined in marriage in my presence and in the presence of these witnesses, I am to remind you of the solemn and binding nature of the relationship into which you are now about to enter.

<p class="subsection2">“Marriage, according to law in Australia, is the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life.”;

<p class="subsection2">or words to that effect.

<p class="subsection">             (2)  Where, in the case of a person authorised under subsection 39(2) to solemnise marriages, the Minister is satisfied that the form of ceremony to be used by that person sufficiently states the nature and obligations of marriage, the Minister may, either by the instrument by which that person is so authorised or by a subsequent instrument, exempt that person from compliance with subsection (1) of this section.

##### 47  Ministers of religion not bound to solemnise marriage etc.

<p class="subsection">                   Nothing in this Part:

<p class="paragraph">                     (a)  imposes an obligation on an authorised celebrant, being a minister of religion, to solemnise any marriage; or

<p class="paragraph">                     (b)  prevents such an authorised celebrant from making it a condition of his or her solemnising a marriage that:

<p class="paragraphsub">                              (i)  longer notice of intention to marry than that required by this Act is given; or

<p class="paragraphsub">                             (ii)  requirements additional to those provided by this Act are observed.

##### 48  Certain marriages not solemnised in accordance with this Division to be invalid

<p class="subsection">             (1)  Subject to this section, a marriage solemnised otherwise than in accordance with the preceding provisions of this Division is not a valid marriage.

<p class="subsection">             (2)  A marriage is not invalid by reason of all or any of the following:

<p class="paragraph">                     (a)  failure to give the notice required by section 42, or a false statement, defect or error in such a notice;

<p class="paragraph">                     (b)  failure of the parties, or either of them, to make or subscribe a declaration as required by section 42, or a false statement, defect or error in such a declaration;

<p class="paragraph">                     (c)  failure to produce to the authorised celebrant a certificate or extract of an entry or a statutory declaration as required by section 42, or a false statement, defect or error in such a statutory declaration;

<p class="paragraph">                     (d)  failure to comply with any other requirement of section 42, or any contravention of that section;

<p class="paragraph">                     (e)  failure to comply with the requirements of section 44 or 46;

<p class="paragraph">                      (f)  failure to comply with the requirements of section 13.

<p class="subsection">             (3)  A marriage is not invalid by reason that the person solemnising it was not authorised by this Act to do so, if either party to the marriage, at the time the marriage was solemnised, believed that that person was lawfully authorised to solemnise it, and in such a case the form and ceremony of the marriage shall be deemed to have been sufficient if they were such as to show an intention on the part of each of the parties to become thereby the lawfully wedded spouse of the other.

##### 49  Authorised celebrant to retain consents, statutory declarations etc.

<p class="subsection">                   An authorised celebrant to whom a consent, dispensation with consent or statutory declaration is produced under this Act shall retain it in his or her possession until he or she deals with it in accordance with section 50.

##### 50  Marriage certificates

<p class="paragraph">                     (b)  where only 1 official certificate has been prepared—retain that certificate and deal with it in accordance with the regulations.

<p class="subsection">             (5)  Where the authorised celebrant dies without having prepared and signed the certificates of the marriage, or where by reason of other special circumstances the Minister thinks it necessary to do so, the Minister may, if satisfied that the marriage was duly solemnised, prepare and sign the certificates with such modifications as are appropriate.

<p class="subsection">             (6)  A certificate prepared and signed by the Minister under subsection (5) has the same force and effect as if it had been prepared and signed, in accordance with this section, by the authorised celebrant.

<p class="subsection">             (7)  The regulations may make provision for and in relation to the furnishing of a substitute certificate in the event of the loss or destruction of a certificate of a marriage previously forwarded in pursuance of this section.

##### 55  Solemnisation of marriages in Australia by foreign diplomatic or consular officer

<p class="subsection">                   Nothing in this Act prevents the solemnisation in Australia of a marriage to which this Division applies by or in the presence of a diplomatic or consular officer of a proclaimed overseas country if:
