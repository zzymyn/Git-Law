 (5)  For the purposes of this section, the fact that a person does not reside in, or is absent from, Australia shall not of itself be deemed to make it impracticable to ascertain the views of that person.

 (2A)  A Judge or magistrate shall not proceed with an inquiry in accordance with subsection (2) unless:

 (4)  Where a magistrate grants an application under subsection (1), the magistrate shall not issue consent in writing to the marriage before the expiration of the time prescribed for the purposes of section 17 and if, within that time, a request for a re‑hearing is made under that section, the magistrate shall not issue consent unless that request is withdrawn.

 (5)  Where a Judge or magistrate gives consent to the marriage of a minor in place of the consent of a person who has refused to consent to the marriage, the Judge or magistrate may also, upon application by the minor, give consent in place of the consent of any other person if the Judge or magistrate is satisfied that it is impracticable, or that it is impracticable without delay that would, in all the circumstances of the case, be unreasonable, to ascertain the views of that person with respect to the proposed marriage.

 (6)  For the purposes of subsection (5), the fact that a person does not reside in, or is absent from, Australia shall not of itself be deemed to make it impracticable to ascertain the views of that person.

 (2)  The fact that an application is heard or dealt with in contravention of subsection (1) does not affect the validity of an order made, or the effectiveness of a consent given, upon the application or the re‑hearing of the application or make ineffective any dispensation with a consent granted on the application.

##### 20  Effect of consent of magistrate or Judge

  Subject to section 21, where a magistrate or a Judge gives his or her consent to the marriage of a minor in place of the consent of another person, his or her consent operates, for the purposes of this Act, as the consent of that other person.

 (3)  Where a consent by a magistrate or a Judge or a dispensation with the consent of a person by a prescribed authority has ceased to have effect, the provisions of this Act apply as if the consent had not been given or dispensed with, as the case may be.

### Division 2—Marriages by authorised celebrants

##### 40  Application of Division

 (1)  Subject to subsection (2), this Division applies to and in relation to all marriages solemnised, or intended to be solemnised, in Australia.

 (2)  This Division does not apply to or in relation to marriages to which Division 3 of this Part applies.

##### 41  Marriages to be solemnised by authorised celebrant

  A marriage shall be solemnised by or in the presence of an authorised celebrant who is authorised to solemnise marriages at the place where the marriage takes place.

##### 42  Notice to be given and declaration made

 (1)  Subject to this section, a marriage shall not be solemnised unless:

  (a)  notice in writing of the intended marriage has been given in accordance with this section and has been received by the authorised celebrant solemnising the marriage not earlier than 18 months before the date of the marriage and not later than 1 month before the date of the marriage;

  (b)  there has been produced to that authorised celebrant, in respect of each of the parties:

   (i)  an official certificate, or an official extract of an entry in an official register, showing the date and place of birth of the party; or

   (ii)  a statutory declaration made by the party or a parent of the party stating that, for reasons specified in the declaration, it is impracticable to obtain such a certificate or extract and stating, to the best of the declarant’s knowledge and belief and as accurately as the declarant has been able to ascertain, when and where the party was born; or

   (iii)  a passport issued by a government of an overseas country, showing the date and place of birth of the party; or

   (iv)  an Australian passport, showing the date and place of birth of the party; and

  (c)  each of the parties has made and subscribed before that authorised celebrant a declaration, in writing, as to:

   (i)  the party’s conjugal status;

   (ii)  the party’s belief that there is no legal impediment to the marriage; and

   (iii)  such other matters as are prescribed.

 (2)  A notice under subsection (1):

  (a)  must contain such particulars in relation to the parties as are prescribed; and

  (b)  must be signed by each of the parties; and

  (c)  if a party signs the notice in Australia—must be signed in the presence of:

   (i)  an authorised celebrant; or

   (ii)  a Commissioner for Declarations under the *Statutory Declarations Act 1959*; or

   (iii)  a justice of the peace; or

   (iv)  a barrister or solicitor; or

   (v)  a legally qualified medical practitioner; or

   (vi)  a member of the Australian Federal Police or the police force of a State or Territory; and

   (v)  an employee of the Australian Trade and Investment Commission authorised under paragraph 3(d) of the *Consular Fees Act 1955*.

 (3)  However, if the signature of a party to an intended marriage cannot conveniently be obtained at the time when it is desired to give notice under this section, a notice duly signed by the other party and otherwise complying with the provisions of this section shall, if it is signed by the first‑mentioned party in the presence of an authorised celebrant before the marriage is solemnised, be deemed to have been a sufficient notice.

 (4)  Where a party to an intended marriage is unable, after reasonable inquiry, to ascertain all of the particulars in relation to that party required to be contained in a notice under this section, the failure to include in the notice such of those particulars as the party is unable to ascertain does not make the notice ineffective for the purposes of this section if, at any time before the marriage is solemnised, that party furnishes to the authorised celebrant solemnising the marriage a statutory declaration as to that party’s inability to ascertain the particulars not included in the notice and the reason for that inability.

 (5)  Despite a notice required by subsection (1) having been received later than 1 month before the date of the marriage, a prescribed authority may authorise an authorised celebrant to solemnise a marriage if the authority is satisfied that one or more of the circumstances prescribed in the regulations have been met.

 (5A)  An authorised celebrant shall, as soon as practicable after receiving the notice referred to in subsection (1), give to the parties a document outlining the obligations and consequences of marriage and indicating the availability of marriage education and counselling.

 (6)  Where, by reason of the death, absence or illness of an authorised celebrant to whom a notice of intention to marry has been given, or for any other reason, it is impracticable for that person to solemnise the marriage, the marriage may be solemnised by any authorised celebrant who has possession of the notice.

 (7)  The declarations of the parties required by subsection (1) shall both be written on the one paper and on the same side of that paper.

 (8)  An authorised celebrant shall not solemnise a marriage:

  (a)  unless the authorised celebrant has satisfied himself or herself that the parties are the parties referred to in the notice given under this section in relation to the marriage; or

  (b)  if the authorised celebrant has reason to believe that:

   (i)  a notice given under this section; or

   (ii)  a declaration made and subscribed under this section, or a statutory declaration made for the purposes of this section;

  in relation to the marriage, contains a false statement or an error or is defective.

 (9)  An authorised celebrant may permit an error in a notice under this section to be corrected in his or her presence by either of the parties at any time before the marriage to which it relates has been solemnised and may treat the corrected notice as having been originally given in its corrected form.

 (10)  Where the declaration made by a party under subsection (1) states that that party is a divorced person or a widow or widower, an authorised celebrant shall not solemnise the marriage unless there is produced to him or her evidence of that party’s divorce, or of the death of that party’s spouse, as the case requires.

##### 42A  Commissioner of Australian Federal Police or approved authority may issue special notice

 (1)  If the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police or a person who is an approved authority for the purposes of the *Witness Protection Act 1994 *gives to a Registrar a certificate under section 14 of that Act stating that the person has received the evidence referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c) of that section and the statutory declaration referred to in paragraph (d) of that section, the Registrar:

  (a)  if he or she is to solemnise the marriage himself or herself—is to treat the certificate as satisfying the requirements of section 42; or

  (b)  in any other case—is to give to the celebrant a notice stating that the celebrant should treat the requirements of section 42 of this Act as having been met.

 (2)  The names specified in the certificate are to be used in the marriage certificate.

##### 43  Marriage may be solemnised on any day etc.

  A marriage may be solemnised on any day, at any time and at any place.

##### 44  Witnesses

  A marriage shall not be solemnised unless at least 2 persons who are, or appear to the person solemnising the marriage to be, over the age of 18 years are present as witnesses.

##### 45  Form of ceremony

 (1)  Where a marriage is solemnised by or in the presence of an authorised celebrant, being a minister of religion, it may be solemnised according to any form and ceremony recognised as sufficient for the purpose by the religious body or organisation of which he or she is a minister.

 (2)  Where a marriage is solemnised by or in the presence of an authorised celebrant, not being a minister of religion, it is sufficient if each of the parties says to the other, in the presence of the authorised celebrant and the witnesses, the words:

  “I call upon the persons here present to witness that I, A.B. (*or* C.D.), take thee, C.D. (*or* A.B.), to be my lawful wedded wife (*or* husband, *or* spouse)”;

  or words to that effect.

 (3)  Where a marriage has been solemnised by or in the presence of an authorised celebrant, a certificate of the marriage prepared and signed in accordance with section 50 is conclusive evidence that the marriage was solemnised in accordance with this section.

 (4)  Nothing in subsection (3) makes a certificate conclusive:

  (a)  where the fact that the marriage ceremony took place is in issue—as to that fact; or

  (b)  where the identity of a party to the marriage is in issue—as to the identity of that party.

##### 46  Certain authorised celebrants to explain nature of marriage relationship

 (1)  Subject to subsection (2), before a marriage is solemnised by or in the presence of an authorised celebrant, not being a minister of religion of a recognised denomination, the authorised celebrant shall say to the parties, in the presence of the witnesses, the words:

  “I am duly authorised by law to solemnise marriages according to law. 

  “Before you are joined in marriage in my presence and in the presence of these witnesses, I am to remind you of the solemn and binding nature of the relationship into which you are now about to enter.

  “Marriage, according to law in Australia, is the union of 2 people to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life.”;

  or words to that effect.

 (2)  Where, in the case of a person authorised under subsection 39(2) to solemnise marriages, the Minister is satisfied that the form of ceremony to be used by that person sufficiently states the nature and obligations of marriage, the Minister may, either by the instrument by which that person is so authorised or by a subsequent instrument, exempt that person from compliance with subsection (1) of this section.

##### 47  Ministers of religion not bound to solemnise marriage etc.

  Nothing in this Part:

  (a)  imposes an obligation on an authorised celebrant, being a minister of religion, to solemnise any marriage; or

  (b)  prevents such an authorised celebrant from making it a condition of his or her solemnising a marriage that:

   (i)  longer notice of intention to marry than that required by this Act is given; or

   (ii)  requirements additional to those provided by this Act are observed.

##### 48  Certain marriages not solemnised in accordance with this Division to be invalid

  (e)  failure to comply with the requirements of section 44 or 46;

  (f)  failure to comply with the requirements of section 13.

 (3)  A marriage is not invalid by reason that the person solemnising it was not authorised by this Act to do so, if either party to the marriage, at the time the marriage was solemnised, believed that that person was lawfully authorised to solemnise it, and in such a case the form and ceremony of the marriage shall be deemed to have been sufficient if they were such as to show an intention on the part of each of the parties to become thereby the lawfully wedded spouse of the other.

##### 49  Authorised celebrant to retain consents, statutory declarations etc.

  An authorised celebrant to whom a consent, dispensation with consent or statutory declaration is produced under this Act shall retain it in his or her possession until he or she deals with it in accordance with section 50.

   (ii)  retain the other official certificate and deal with it in accordance with the regulations; or

  (b)  where only 1 official certificate has been prepared—retain that certificate and deal with it in accordance with the regulations.

 (5)  Where the authorised celebrant dies without having prepared and signed the certificates of the marriage, or where by reason of other special circumstances the Minister thinks it necessary to do so, the Minister may, if satisfied that the marriage was duly solemnised, prepare and sign the certificates with such modifications as are appropriate.

 (1)  In this Part, unless the contrary intention appears:

  **Australia** includes the external Territories.

 (3)  In this Part, a reference to a marriage includes a reference to a purported marriage that is void or voidable but does not include a reference to a marriage solemnised under Part V.

 (1)  This Part applies to and in relation to every marriage solemnised, whether before or after the commencement of this Part, in a foreign country where:

  (a)  under the local law, the marriage was, at the time when it was solemnised, recognised as valid; or

   (i)  under the law of that other foreign country, the marriage was, at the time when it was solemnised, recognised as valid; and

   (ii)  at the time when it was solemnised, the solemnisation of the marriage was not prohibited by the local law.

 (2)  Where a marriage (not being a marriage referred to in subsection (1)) that was solemnised, whether before or after the commencement of this Part, in a foreign country:

  (a)  is, at any time in relation to which the validity of the marriage falls to be determined, recognised as valid under the local law; or

  (b)  if the marriage was solemnised by or in the presence of a diplomatic or consular officer of another foreign country and, at the time when it was solemnised, the solemnisation of the marriage was not prohibited by the local law—is, at any time in relation to which the validity of the marriage falls to be determined, recognised as valid under the law of that other foreign country;

  this Part applies to and in relation to the marriage from and including that time.

##### 88D  Validity of marriages

 (1)  Subject to this section, a marriage to which this Part applies shall be recognised in Australia as valid.

 (2)  A marriage to which this Part applies shall not be recognised as valid in accordance with subsection (1) if:

  (a)  either of the parties was, at the time of the marriage, a party to a marriage with some other person and the last‑mentioned marriage was, at that time, recognised in Australia as valid;

  (b)  where one of the parties was, at the time of the marriage, domiciled in Australia—either of the parties was not of marriageable age within the meaning of Part II;

  (c)  the parties are within a prohibited relationship within the meaning of section 23B; or

  (d)  the consent of either of the parties was not a real consent for a reason set out in subparagraph 23B(1)(d)(i), (ii) or (iii).

 (4)  A marriage solemnised in a foreign country, being a marriage to which this Part applies, shall not be recognised as valid in accordance with subsection (1) at any time while the marriage is voidable:

  (a)  except in a case to which paragraph (b) applies—under the local law; or

  (b)  if the marriage was solemnised in a foreign country by or in the presence of a diplomatic or consular officer of another foreign country—under the law of that other foreign country.

 (5)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Part, where:

  (a)  a marriage (in this subsection referred to as the **initial marriage**) has, whether before or after the commencement of this Part, been solemnised in a foreign country;

  (b)  at the time of the solemnisation of the initial marriage, that marriage was not recognised in Australia as valid;

  (c)  after the solemnisation of the initial marriage, and whether before or after the commencement of this Part, either party to that marriage entered into another marriage (in this subsection referred to as the **subsequent marriage**); and

 (3)  Where a marriage solemnised in a foreign country is not required by virtue of this Part to be recognised in Australia as valid, this Part shall not be taken to limit or exclude the operation of a provision of any other law of the Commonwealth, or of a law of a State or Territory, that provides, expressly or impliedly, for such a marriage to be recognised as a valid marriage for the purposes of the law in which the provision is included.

 (4)  This Part shall not be taken to limit or exclude the operation of a provision of any other law of the Commonwealth, or of a law of a State or Territory, that deems a union in the nature of a marriage to be a marriage for the purposes of the law in which the provision is included.

##### 88EA  Certain unions are not marriages

  A union solemnised in a foreign country between:

  (a)  in relation to a foreign country:

  (c)  neither parent of the child was domiciled in Australia at the time of the marriage; and

  (d)  the law of the place where a parent of the child was then domiciled did not recognise the status of illegitimacy or, if the law of the place where a parent of the child was then domiciled did recognise that status, the child was, by that law, legitimated by virtue of the marriage;

  the child is for all purposes the legitimate child of his or her parents as from the time of the marriage or the commencement of section 25 of the *Marriage Amendment Act 1985*, whichever was the later.

  (a)  to be treated as the child of the woman;
